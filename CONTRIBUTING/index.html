                <h1 id="contributions-welcome">Contributions Welcome!</h1>
<p>We welcome contributions to Hyperledger in many forms, and there\'s
always plenty to do!</p>
<p>First things first, please review the Hyperledger <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/community/hyperledger-project-code-of-conduct">Code of
Conduct</a>
before participating. It is important that we keep things civil.</p>
<h2 id="install-prerequisites">Install prerequisites</h2>
<p>Before we begin, if you haven\'t already done so, you may wish to check
that you have all the [prerequisites \&lt;prereqs>]{role="doc"} installed
on the platform(s) on which you\'ll be developing blockchain
applications and/or operating Hyperledger Fabric.</p>
<h2 id="getting-a-linux-foundation-account">Getting a Linux Foundation account</h2>
<p>In order to participate in the development of the Hyperledger Fabric
project, you will need a [Linux Foundation
account \&lt;Gerrit/lf-account>]{role="doc"}. You will need to use your LF
ID to access to all the Hyperledger community development tools,
including <a href="https://gerrit.hyperledger.org">Gerrit</a>,
<a href="https://jira.hyperledger.org">Jira</a> and the
<a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/start">Wiki</a> (for editing, only).</p>
<h2 id="getting-help">Getting help</h2>
<p>If you are looking for something to work on, or need some expert
assistance in debugging a problem or working out a fix to an issue, our
<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/community">community</a> is always eager to
help. We hang out on
<a href="https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric/">Chat</a>, IRC (#hyperledger
on freenode.net) and the <a href="http://lists.hyperledger.org/">mailing lists</a>.
Most of us don\'t bite :grin: and will be glad to help. The only silly
question is the one you don\'t ask. Questions are in fact a great way to
help improve the project as they highlight where our documentation could
be clearer.</p>
<h2 id="reporting-bugs">Reporting bugs</h2>
<p>If you are a user and you have found a bug, please submit an issue using
<a href="https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10104">JIRA</a>.
Before you create a new JIRA issue, please try to search the existing
items to be sure no one else has previously reported it. If it has been
previously reported, then you might add a comment that you also are
interested in seeing the defect fixed.</p>
<p>::: {.note}
::: {.admonition-title}
Note
:::</p>
<p>If the defect is security-related, please follow the Hyperledger</p>
<p>:   security bug reporting process \&lt;https://wiki.hyperledger.org/security/bug-handling-process>.
:::</p>
<p>If it has not been previously reported, create a new JIRA. Please try to
provide sufficient information for someone else to reproduce the issue.
One of the project\'s maintainers should respond to your issue within 24
hours. If not, please bump the issue with a comment and request that it
be reviewed. You can also post to the relevant fabric channel in
<a href="https://chat.hyperledger.org">Hyperledger Rocket Chat</a>. For example, a
doc bug should be broadcast to <code>#fabric-documentation</code>, a database bug
to <code>#fabric-ledger</code>, and so on...</p>
<h2 id="submitting-your-fix">Submitting your fix</h2>
<p>If you just submitted a JIRA for a bug you\'ve discovered, and would
like to provide a fix, we would welcome that gladly! Please assign the
JIRA issue to yourself, then you can submit a change request (CR).</p>
<p>::: {.note}
::: {.admonition-title}
Note
:::</p>
<p>If you need help with submitting your first CR, we have created a</p>
<p>:   brief [tutorial \&lt;submit_cr>]{role="doc"} for you.
:::</p>
<h2 id="fixing-issues-and-working-stories">Fixing issues and working stories</h2>
<p>Review the <a href="https://jira.hyperledger.org/issues/?filter=10580">issues
list</a> and find
something that interests you. You could also check the
<a href="https://jira.hyperledger.org/issues/?filter=10147">\"help-wanted\"</a>
list. It is wise to start with something relatively straight forward and
achievable, and that no one is already assigned. If no one is assigned,
then assign the issue to yourself. Please be considerate and rescind the
assignment if you cannot finish in a reasonable time, or add a comment
saying that you are still actively working the issue if you need a
little more time.</p>
<h2 id="making-featureenhancement-proposals">Making Feature/Enhancement Proposals</h2>
<p>Review
<a href="https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10104">JIRA</a>.
to be sure that there isn\'t already an open (or recently closed)
proposal for the same function. If there isn\'t, to make a proposal we
recommend that you open a JIRA Epic, Story or Improvement, whichever
seems to best fit the circumstance and link or inline a \"one pager\" of
the proposal that states what the feature would do and, if possible, how
it might be implemented. It would help also to make a case for why the
feature should be added, such as identifying specific use case(s) for
which the feature is needed and a case for what the benefit would be
should the feature be implemented. Once the JIRA issue is created, and
the \"one pager\" either attached, inlined in the description field, or
a link to a publicly accessible document is added to the description,
send an introductory email to the
<a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#104;&#121;&#112;&#101;&#114;&#108;&#101;&#100;&#103;&#101;&#114;&#45;&#102;&#97;&#98;&#114;&#105;&#99;&#64;&#108;&#105;&#115;&#116;&#115;&#46;&#104;&#121;&#112;&#101;&#114;&#108;&#101;&#100;&#103;&#101;&#114;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#104;&#121;&#112;&#101;&#114;&#108;&#101;&#100;&#103;&#101;&#114;&#45;&#102;&#97;&#98;&#114;&#105;&#99;&#64;&#108;&#105;&#115;&#116;&#115;&#46;&#104;&#121;&#112;&#101;&#114;&#108;&#101;&#100;&#103;&#101;&#114;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a> mailing list linking the JIRA
issue, and soliciting feedback.</p>
<p>Discussion of the proposed feature should be conducted in the JIRA issue
itself, so that we have a consistent pattern within our community as to
where to find design discussion.</p>
<p>Getting the support of three or more of the Hyperledger Fabric
maintainers for the new feature will greatly enhance the probability
that the feature\'s related CRs will be merged.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-development-environment">Setting up development environment</h2>
<p>Next, try [building the project \&lt;dev-setup/build>]{role="doc"} in your
local development environment to ensure that everything is set up
correctly.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-a-good-change-request">What makes a good change request?</h2>
<ul>
<li>One change at a time. Not five, not three, not ten. One and only
    one. Why? Because it limits the blast area of the change. If we have
    a regression, it is much easier to identify the culprit commit than
    if we have some composite change that impacts more of the code.</li>
<li>Include a link to the JIRA story for the change. Why? Because a) we
    want to track our velocity to better judge what we think we can
    deliver and when and b) because we can justify the change more
    effectively. In many cases, there should be some discussion around a
    proposed change and we want to link back to that from the change
    itself.</li>
<li>Include unit and integration tests (or changes to existing tests)
    with every change. This does not mean just happy path testing,
    either. It also means negative testing of any defensive code that it
    correctly catches input errors. When you write code, you are
    responsible to test it and provide the tests that demonstrate that
    your change does what it claims. Why? Because without this we have
    no clue whether our current code base actually works.</li>
<li>Unit tests should have NO external dependencies. You should be able
    to run unit tests in place with <code>go test</code> or equivalent for the
    language. Any test that requires some external dependency (e.g.
    needs to be scripted to run another component) needs appropriate
    mocking. Anything else is not unit testing, it is integration
    testing by definition. Why? Because many open source developers do
    Test Driven Development. They place a watch on the directory that
    invokes the tests automagically as the code is changed. This is far
    more efficient than having to run a whole build between code
    changes. See <a href="http://artofunittesting.com/definition-of-a-unit-test/">this
    definition</a>
    of unit testing for a good set of criteria to keep in mind for
    writing effective unit tests.</li>
<li>Minimize the lines of code per CR. Why? Maintainers have day jobs,
    too. If you send a 1,000 or 2,000 LOC change, how long do you think
    it takes to review all of that code? Keep your changes to \&lt; 200-300
    LOC, if possible. If you have a larger change, decompose it into
    multiple independent changess. If you are adding a bunch of new
    functions to fulfill the requirements of a new capability, add them
    separately with their tests, and then write the code that uses them
    to deliver the capability. Of course, there are always exceptions.
    If you add a small change and then add 300 LOC of tests, you will be
    forgiven;-) If you need to make a change that has broad impact or a
    bunch of generated code (protobufs, etc.). Again, there can be
    exceptions.</li>
</ul>
<p>::: {.note}
::: {.admonition-title}
Note
:::</p>
<p>Large change requests, e.g. those with more than 300 LOC are more likely</p>
<p>:   than not going to receive a -2, and you\'ll be asked to refactor the
    change to conform with this guidance.
:::</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not stack change requests (e.g. submit a CR from the same local
    branch as your previous CR) unless they are related. This will
    minimize merge conflicts and allow changes to be merged more
    quickly. If you stack requests your subsequent requests may be held
    up because of review comments in the preceding requests.</li>
<li>Write a meaningful commit message. Include a meaningful 50 (or less)
    character title, followed by a blank line, followed by a more
    comprehensive description of the change. Each change MUST include
    the JIRA identifier corresponding to the change (e.g. [FAB-1234]).
    This can be in the title but should also be in the body of the
    commit message. See the
    [complete requirements \&lt;Gerrit/changes>]{role="doc"} for an
    acceptable change request.</li>
</ul>
<p>::: {.note}
::: {.admonition-title}
Note
:::</p>
<p>That Gerrit will automatically create a hyperlink to the JIRA item.</p>
<p>:   e.g.</p>
<!-- -->

<pre><code>[FAB-1234] fix foobar() panic

Fix [FAB-1234] added a check to ensure that when foobar(foo string)
is called, that there is a non-empty string argument.
</code></pre>
<p>:::</p>
<p>Finally, be responsive. Don\'t let a change request fester with review
comments such that it gets to a point that it requires a rebase. It only
further delays getting it merged and adds more work for you - to
remediate the merge conflicts.</p>
<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>
<p>We use <a href="https://chat.hyperledger.org/">RocketChat</a> for communication and
Google Hangouts™ for screen sharing between developers. Our development
planning and prioritization is done in
<a href="https://jira.hyperledger.org">JIRA</a>, and we take longer running
discussions/decisions to the <a href="http://lists.hyperledger.org/mailman/listinfo/hyperledger-fabric">mailing
list</a>.</p>
<h2 id="maintainers">Maintainers</h2>
<p>The project\'s [maintainers \&lt;MAINTAINERS>]{role="doc"} are responsible
for reviewing and merging all patches submitted for review and they
guide the over-all technical direction of the project within the
guidelines established by the Hyperledger Technical Steering Committee
(TSC).</p>
<h3 id="becoming-a-maintainer">Becoming a maintainer</h3>
<p>This project is managed under an open governance model as described in
our <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/about/charter">charter</a>. Projects or
sub-projects will be lead by a set of maintainers. New sub-projects can
designate an initial set of maintainers that will be approved by the
top-level project\'s existing maintainers when the project is first
approved. The project\'s maintainers will, from time-to-time, consider
adding or removing a maintainer. An existing maintainer can submit a
change set to the [MAINTAINERS.rst \&lt;MAINTAINERS>]{role="doc"} file. A
nominated Contributor may become a Maintainer by a majority approval of
the proposal by the existing Maintainers. Once approved, the change set
is then merged and the individual is added to (or alternatively, removed
from) the maintainers group. Maintainers may be removed by explicit
resignation, for prolonged inactivity (3 or more months), or for some
infraction of the <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/community/hyperledger-project-code-of-conduct">code of
conduct</a>
or by consistently demonstrating poor judgement. A maintainer removed
for inactivity should be restored following a sustained resumption of
contributions and reviews (a month or more) demonstrating a renewed
commitment to the project.</p>
<h2 id="legal-stuff">Legal stuff</h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Each source file must include a license header for the Apache
Software License 2.0. See the template of the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/source/dev-setup/headers.txt">license
header</a>.</p>
<p>We have tried to make it as easy as possible to make contributions. This
applies to how we handle the legal aspects of contribution. We use the
same approach---the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/source/DCO1.1.txt">Developer\'s Certificate of Origin 1.1
(DCO)</a>---that
the Linux® Kernel
<a href="http://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin">community</a> uses to
manage code contributions.</p>
<p>We simply ask that when submitting a patch for review, the developer
must include a sign-off statement in the commit message.</p>
<p>Here is an example Signed-off-by line, which indicates that the
submitter accepts the DCO:</p>
<pre><code>Signed-off-by: John Doe &lt;john.doe@hisdomain.com&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You can include this automatically when you commit a change to your
local git repository using <code>git commit -s</code>.</p>
