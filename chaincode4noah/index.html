                <h1 id="chaincode-for-operators">Chaincode for Operators</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-chaincode">What is Chaincode?</h2>
<p>Chaincode is a program, written in <a href="https://golang.org">Go</a>, and
eventually in other programming languages such as Java, that implements
a prescribed interface. Chaincode runs in a secured Docker container
isolated from the endorsing peer process. Chaincode initializes and
manages ledger state through transactions submitted by applications.</p>
<p>A chaincode typically handles business logic agreed to by members of the
network, so it may be considered as a \"smart contract\". State created
by a chaincode is scoped exclusively to that chaincode and can\'t be
accessed directly by another chaincode. However, within the same
network, given the appropriate permission a chaincode may invoke another
chaincode to access its state.</p>
<p>In the following sections, we will explore chaincode through the eyes of
a blockchain network operator, Noah. For Noah\'s interests, we will
focus on chaincode lifecycle operations; the process of packaging,
installing, instantiating and upgrading the chaincode as a function of
the chaincode\'s operational lifecycle within a blockchain network.</p>
<h2 id="chaincode-lifecycle">Chaincode lifecycle</h2>
<p>The Hyperledger Fabric API enables interaction with the various nodes in
a blockchain network - the peers, orderers and MSPs - and it also allows
one to package, install, instantiate and upgrade chaincode on the
endorsing peer nodes. The Hyperledger Fabric language-specific SDKs
abstract the specifics of the Hyperledger Fabric API to facilitate
application development, though it can be used to manage a chaincode\'s
lifecycle. Additionally, the Hyperledger Fabric API can be accessed
directly via the CLI, which we will use in this document.</p>
<p>We provide four commands to manage a chaincode\'s lifecycle: <code>package</code>,
<code>install</code>, <code>instantiate</code>, and <code>upgrade</code>. In a future release, we are
considering adding <code>stop</code> and <code>start</code> transactions to disable and
re-enable a chaincode without having to actually uninstall it. After a
chaincode has been successfully installed and instantiated, the
chaincode is active (running) and can process transactions via the
<code>invoke</code> transaction. A chaincode may be upgraded any time after it has
been installed.</p>
<p>::: {#Package}
Packaging</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>The chaincode package consists of 3 parts:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>the chaincode, as defined by <code>ChaincodeDeploymentSpec</code> or CDS. The
    CDS defines the chaincode package in terms of the code and other
    properties such as name and version,</li>
<li>an optional instantiation policy which can be syntactically
    described by the same policy used for endorsement and described in
    [endorsement-policies]{role="doc"}, and</li>
<li>a set of signatures by the entities that "own" the chaincode.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The signatures serve the following purposes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>to establish an ownership of the chaincode,</li>
<li>to allow verification of the contents of the package, and</li>
<li>to allow detection of package tampering.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The creator of the instantiation transaction of the chaincode on a
channel is validated against the instantiation policy of the chaincode.</p>
<h3 id="creating-the-package">Creating the package</h3>
<p>There are two approaches to packaging chaincode. One for when you want
to have multiple owners of a chaincode, and hence need to have the
chaincode package signed by multiple identities. This workflow requires
that we initially create a signed chaincode package (a <code>SignedCDS</code>)
which is subsequently passed serially to each of the other owners for
signing.</p>
<p>The simpler workflow is for when you are deploying a SignedCDS that has
only the signature of the identity of the node that is issuing the
<code>install</code> transaction.</p>
<p>We will address the more complex case first. However, you may skip ahead
to the [Install]{role="ref"} section below if you do not need to worry
about multiple owners just yet.</p>
<p>To create a signed chaincode package, use the following command:</p>
<p>``` {.sourceCode .bash}
peer chaincode package -n mycc -p github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/chaincode_example02 -v 0 -s -S -i "AND('OrgA.admin')" ccpack.out</p>
<pre><code>
The `-s` option creates a package that can be signed by multiple owners
as opposed to simply creating a raw CDS. When `-s` is specified, the
`-S` option must also be specified if other owners are going to need to
sign. Otherwise, the process will create a SignedCDS that includes only
the instantiation policy in addition to the CDS.

The `-S` option directs the process to sign the package using the MSP
identified by the value of the `localMspid` property in `core.yaml`.

The `-S` option is optional. However if a package is created without a
signature, it cannot be signed by any other owner using the
`signpackage` command.

The optional `-i` option allows one to specify an instantiation policy
for the chaincode. The instantiation policy has the same format as an
endorsement policy and specifies which identities can instantiate the
chaincode. In the example above, only the admin of OrgA is allowed to
instantiate the chaincode. If no policy is provided, the default policy
is used, which only allows the admin identity of the peer\'s MSP to
instantiate chaincode.

### Package signing

A chaincode package that was signed at creation can be handed over to
other owners for inspection and signing. The workflow supports
out-of-band signing of chaincode package.

The
[ChaincodeDeploymentSpec](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/protos/peer/chaincode.proto#L78)
may be optionally be signed by the collective owners to create a
[SignedChaincodeDeploymentSpec](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/protos/peer/signed_cc_dep_spec.proto#L26)
(or SignedCDS). The SignedCDS contains 3 elements:

&gt; 1.  The CDS contains the source code, the name, and version of the
&gt;     chaincode.
&gt; 2.  An instantiation policy of the chaincode, expressed as endorsement
&gt;     policies.
&gt; 3.  The list of chaincode owners, defined by means of
&gt;     [Endorsement](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/protos/peer/proposal_response.proto#L111).

::: {.note}
::: {.admonition-title}
Note
:::

Note that this endorsement policy is determined out-of-band to

:   provide proper MSP principals when the chaincode is instantiated on
    some channels. If the instantiation policy is not specified, the
    default policy is any MSP administrator of the channel.
:::

Each owner endorses the ChaincodeDeploymentSpec by combining it with
that owner\'s identity (e.g. certificate) and signing the combined
result.

A chaincode owner can sign a previously created signed package using the
following command:

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
peer chaincode signpackage ccpack.out signedccpack.out
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>ccpack.out</code> and <code>signedccpack.out</code> are the input and output
packages, respectively. <code>signedccpack.out</code> contains an additional
signature over the package signed using the Local MSP.</p>
<p>::: {#Install}</p>
<h3 id="installing-chaincode">Installing chaincode</h3>
<p>:::</p>
<p>The <code>install</code> transaction packages a chaincode\'s source code into a
prescribed format called a <code>ChaincodeDeploymentSpec</code> (or CDS) and
installs it on a peer node that will run that chaincode.</p>
<p>::: {.note}
::: {.admonition-title}
Note
:::</p>
<p>You must install the chaincode on <strong>each</strong> endorsing peer node</p>
<p>:   of a channel that will run your chaincode.
:::</p>
<p>When the <code>install</code> API is given simply a <code>ChaincodeDeploymentSpec</code>, it
will default the instantiation policy and include an empty owner list.</p>
<p>::: {.note}
::: {.admonition-title}
Note
:::</p>
<p>Chaincode should only be installed on endorsing peer nodes of the</p>
<p>:   owning members of the chaincode to protect the confidentiality of
    the chaincode logic from other members on the network. Those members
    without the chaincode, can\'t be the endorsers of the chaincode\'s
    transactions; that is, they can\'t execute the chaincode. However,
    they can still validate and commit the transactions to the ledger.
:::</p>
<p>To install a chaincode, send a
<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/protos/peer/proposal.proto#L104">SignedProposal</a>
to the <code>lifecycle system chaincode</code> (LSCC) described in the <a href="#system-chaincode">System
Chaincode</a> section. For example, to install the
<strong>sacc</strong> sample chaincode described in section
[simple asset chaincode]{role="ref"} using the CLI, the command would
look like the following:</p>
<p>``` {.sourceCode .bash}
peer chaincode install -n asset_mgmt -v 1.0 -p sacc</p>
<pre><code>
The CLI internally creates the SignedChaincodeDeploymentSpec for
**sacc** and sends it to the local peer, which calls the `Install`
method on the LSCC. The argument to the `-p` option specifies the path
to the chaincode, which must be located within the source tree of the
user\'s `GOPATH`, e.g. `$GOPATH/src/sacc`. See the [CLI](#cli) section
for a complete description of the command options.

Note that in order to install on a peer, the signature of the
SignedProposal must be from 1 of the peer\'s local MSP administrators.

::: {#Instantiate}
### Instantiate
:::

The `instantiate` transaction invokes the `lifecycle System Chaincode`
(LSCC) to create and initialize a chaincode on a channel. This is a
chaincode-channel binding process: a chaincode may be bound to any
number of channels and operate on each channel individually and
independently. In other words, regardless of how many other channels on
which a chaincode might be installed and instantiated, state is kept
isolated to the channel to which a transaction is submitted.

The creator of an `instantiate` transaction must satisfy the
instantiation policy of the chaincode included in SignedCDS and must
also be a writer on the channel, which is configured as part of the
channel creation. This is important for the security of the channel to
prevent rogue entities from deploying chaincodes or tricking members to
execute chaincodes on an unbound channel.

For example, recall that the default instantiation policy is any channel
MSP administrator, so the creator of a chaincode instantiate transaction
must be a member of the channel administrators. When the transaction
proposal arrives at the endorser, it verifies the creator\'s signature
against the instantiation policy. This is done again during the
transaction validation before committing it to the ledger.

The instantiate transaction also sets up the endorsement policy for that
chaincode on the channel. The endorsement policy describes the
attestation requirements for the transaction result to be accepted by
members of the channel.

For example, using the CLI to instantiate the **sacc** chaincode and
initialize the state with `john` and `0`, the command would look like
the following:

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
peer chaincode instantiate -n sacc -v 1.0 -c '{&quot;Args&quot;:[&quot;john&quot;,&quot;0&quot;]}' -P &quot;OR ('Org1.member','Org2.member')&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>::: {.note}
::: {.admonition-title}
Note
:::</p>
<p>Note the endorsement policy (CLI uses polish notation), which requires an</p>
<p>:   endorsement from either member of Org1 or Org2 for all transactions
    to <strong>sacc</strong>. That is, either Org1 or Org2 must sign the result of
    executing the Invoke on <strong>sacc</strong> for the transactions to be valid.
:::</p>
<p>After being successfully instantiated, the chaincode enters the active
state on the channel and is ready to process any transaction proposals
of type
<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/protos/common/common.proto#L42">ENDORSER_TRANSACTION</a>.
The transactions are processed concurrently as they arrive at the
endorsing peer.</p>
<p>::: {#Upgrade}</p>
<h3 id="upgrade">Upgrade</h3>
<p>:::</p>
<p>A chaincode may be upgraded any time by changing its version, which is
part of the SignedCDS. Other parts, such as owners and instantiation
policy are optional. However, the chaincode name must be the same;
otherwise it would be considered as a totally different chaincode.</p>
<p>Prior to upgrade, the new version of the chaincode must be installed on
the required endorsers. Upgrade is a transaction similar to the
instantiate transaction, which binds the new version of the chaincode to
the channel. Other channels bound to the old version of the chaincode
still run with the old version. In other words, the <code>upgrade</code>
transaction only affects one channel at a time, the channel to which the
transaction is submitted.</p>
<p>::: {.note}
::: {.admonition-title}
Note
:::</p>
<p>Note that since multiple versions of a chaincode may be active</p>
<p>:   simultaneously, the upgrade process doesn\'t automatically remove
    the old versions, so user must manage this for the time being.
:::</p>
<p>There\'s one subtle difference with the <code>instantiate</code> transaction: the
<code>upgrade</code> transaction is checked against the current chaincode
instantiation policy, not the new policy (if specified). This is to
ensure that only existing members specified in the current instantiation
policy may upgrade the chaincode.</p>
<p>::: {.note}
::: {.admonition-title}
Note
:::</p>
<p>Note that during upgrade, the chaincode <code>Init</code> function is called to</p>
<p>:   perform any data related updates or re-initialize it, so care must
    be taken to avoid resetting states when upgrading chaincode.
:::</p>
<p>::: {#Stop-and-Start}</p>
<h3 id="stop-and-start">Stop and Start</h3>
<p>:::</p>
<p>Note that <code>stop</code> and <code>start</code> lifecycle transactions have not yet been
implemented. However, you may stop a chaincode manually by removing the
chaincode container and the SignedCDS package from each of the
endorsers. This is done by deleting the chaincode\'s container on each
of the hosts or virtual machines on which the endorsing peer nodes are
running, and then deleting the SignedCDS from each of the endorsing peer
nodes:</p>
<p>::: {.note}
::: {.admonition-title}
Note
:::</p>
<p>TODO - in order to delete the CDS from the peer node, you would need</p>
<p>:   to enter the peer node\'s container, first. We really need to
    provide a utility script that can do this.
:::</p>
<p>``` {.sourceCode .bash}
docker rm -f <container id>
rm /var/hyperledger/production/chaincodes/<ccname>:<ccversion></p>
<pre><code>
Stop would be useful in the workflow for doing upgrade in controlled
manner, where a chaincode can be stopped on a channel on all peers
before issuing an upgrade.

::: {.note}
::: {.admonition-title}
Note
:::

We are assessing the need to distribute platform-specific binaries

:   for the Hyperledger Fabric `peer` binary. For the time being, you
    can simply invoke the commands from within a running docker
    container.
:::

To view the currently available CLI commands, execute the following
command from within a running `fabric-peer` Docker container:

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
docker run -it hyperledger/fabric-peer bash
# peer chaincode --help
</code></pre>

<p>Which shows output similar to the example below:</p>
<p>``` {.sourceCode .bash}
Usage:
  peer chaincode [command]</p>
<p>Available Commands:
  install     Package the specified chaincode into a deployment spec and save it on the peer's path.
  instantiate Deploy the specified chaincode to the network.
  invoke      Invoke the specified chaincode.
  list        Get the instantiated chaincodes on a channel or installed chaincodes on a peer.
  package     Package the specified chaincode into a deployment spec.
  query       Query using the specified chaincode.
  signpackage Sign the specified chaincode package
  upgrade     Upgrade chaincode.</p>
<p>Flags:
    --cafile string      Path to file containing PEM-encoded trusted certificate(s) for the ordering endpoint
-h, --help               help for chaincode
-o, --orderer string     Ordering service endpoint
    --tls                Use TLS when communicating with the orderer endpoint
    --transient string   Transient map of arguments in JSON encoding</p>
<pre><code>
Global Flags:

:   \--logging-level string Default logging level and overrides, see
    core.yaml for full syntax \--test.coverprofile string Done (default
    \&quot;coverage.cov\&quot;)

&gt; -v, \--version
&gt;
&gt; Use \&quot;peer chaincode \[command\] \--help\&quot; for more information about
&gt; a command.

To facilitate its use in scripted applications, the `peer` command
always produces a non-zero return code in the event of command failure.

Example of chaincode commands:

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
peer chaincode install -n mycc -v 0 -p path/to/my/chaincode/v0
peer chaincode instantiate -n mycc -v 0 -c '{&quot;Args&quot;:[&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;]}' -C mychannel
peer chaincode install -n mycc -v 1 -p path/to/my/chaincode/v1
peer chaincode upgrade -n mycc -v 1 -c '{&quot;Args&quot;:[&quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;f&quot;]}' -C mychannel
peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n mycc -c '{&quot;Args&quot;:[&quot;query&quot;,&quot;e&quot;]}'
peer chaincode invoke -o orderer.example.com:7050  --tls --cafile $ORDERER_CA -C mychannel -n mycc -c '{&quot;Args&quot;:[&quot;invoke&quot;,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;10&quot;]}'

<p>::: {#System Chaincode}
System chaincode</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>System chaincode has the same programming model except that it runs
within the peer process rather than in an isolated container like normal
chaincode. Therefore, system chaincode is built into the peer executable
and doesn\'t follow the same lifecycle described above. In particular,
<strong>install</strong>, <strong>instantiate</strong> and <strong>upgrade</strong> do not apply to system
chaincodes.</p>
<p>The purpose of system chaincode is to shortcut gRPC communication cost
between peer and chaincode, and tradeoff the flexibility in management.
For example, a system chaincode can only be upgraded with the peer
binary. It must also register with a <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/core/scc/importsysccs.go">fixed set of
parameters</a>
compiled in and doesn\'t have endorsement policies or endorsement policy
functionality.</p>
<p>System chaincode is used in Hyperledger Fabric to implement a number of
system behaviors so that they can be replaced or modified as appropriate
by a system integrator.</p>
<p>The current list of system chaincodes:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/master/core/scc/lscc">LSCC</a>
    Lifecycle system chaincode handles lifecycle requests described
    above.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/master/core/scc/cscc">CSCC</a>
    Configuration system chaincode handles channel configuration on the
    peer side.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/master/core/scc/qscc">QSCC</a>
    Query system chaincode provides ledger query APIs such as getting
    blocks and transactions.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/master/core/scc/escc">ESCC</a>
    Endorsement system chaincode handles endorsement by signing the
    transaction proposal response.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/master/core/scc/vscc">VSCC</a>
    Validation system chaincode handles the transaction validation,
    including checking endorsement policy and multiversioning
    concurrency control.</li>
</ol>
<p>Care must be taken when modifying or replacing these system chaincodes,
especially LSCC, ESCC and VSCC since they are in the main transaction
execution path. It is worth noting that as VSCC validates a block before
committing it to the ledger, it is important that all peers in the
channel compute the same validation to avoid ledger divergence
(non-determinism). So special care is needed if VSCC is modified or
replaced.</p>
