<p>This section outlines the key design features woven into Hyperledger
Fabric that fulfill its promise of a comprehensive, yet customizable,
enterprise blockchain solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Assets]{role="ref"} - Asset definitions enable the exchange of
    almost anything with monetary value over the network, from whole
    foods to antique cars to currency futures.</li>
<li>[Chaincode]{role="ref"} - Chaincode execution is partitioned from
    transaction ordering, limiting the required levels of trust and
    verification across node types, and optimizing network scalability
    and performance.</li>
<li>[Ledger-Features]{role="ref"} - The immutable, shared ledger encodes
    the entire transaction history for each channel, and includes
    SQL-like query capability for efficient auditing and dispute
    resolution.</li>
<li>[Privacy-through-Channels]{role="ref"} - Channels enable
    multi-lateral transactions with the high degrees of privacy and
    confidentiality required by competing businesses and regulated
    industries that exchange assets on a common network.</li>
<li>[Security-Membership-Services]{role="ref"} - Permissioned membership
    provides a trusted blockchain network, where participants know that
    all transactions can be detected and traced by authorized regulators
    and auditors.</li>
<li>[Consensus]{role="ref"} - a unique approach to consensus enables the
    flexibility and scalability needed for the enterprise.</li>
</ul>
<p>::: {#Assets}
Assets</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>Assets can range from the tangible (real estate and hardware) to the
intangible (contracts and intellectual property). Hyperledger Fabric
provides the ability to modify assets using chaincode transactions.</p>
<p>Assets are represented in Hyperledger Fabric as a collection of
key-value pairs, with state changes recorded as transactions on a
[Channel]{role="ref"} ledger. Assets can be represented in binary and/or
JSON form.</p>
<p>You can easily define and use assets in your Hyperledger Fabric
applications using the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/composer">Hyperledger
Composer</a> tool.</p>
<p>::: {#Chaincode}
Chaincode</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>Chaincode is software defining an asset or assets, and the transaction
instructions for modifying the asset(s). In other words, it\'s the
business logic. Chaincode enforces the rules for reading or altering key
value pairs or other state database information. Chaincode functions
execute against the ledger\'s current state database and are initiated
through a transaction proposal. Chaincode execution results in a set of
key value writes (write set) that can be submitted to the network and
applied to the ledger on all peers.</p>
<p>::: {#Ledger-Features}
Ledger Features</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>The ledger is the sequenced, tamper-resistant record of all state
transitions in the fabric. State transitions are a result of chaincode
invocations (\'transactions\') submitted by participating parties. Each
transaction results in a set of asset key-value pairs that are committed
to the ledger as creates, updates, or deletes.</p>
<p>The ledger is comprised of a blockchain (\'chain\') to store the
immutable, sequenced record in blocks, as well as a state database to
maintain current fabric state. There is one ledger per channel. Each
peer maintains a copy of the ledger for each channel of which they are a
member.</p>
<ul>
<li>Query and update ledger using key-based lookups, range queries, and
    composite key queries</li>
<li>Read-only queries using a rich query language (if using CouchDB as
    state database)</li>
<li>Read-only history queries - Query ledger history for a key, enabling
    data provenance scenarios</li>
<li>Transactions consist of the versions of keys/values that were read
    in chaincode (read set) and keys/values that were written in
    chaincode (write set)</li>
<li>Transactions contain signatures of every endorsing peer and are
    submitted to ordering service</li>
<li>Transactions are ordered into blocks and are \"delivered\" from an
    ordering service to peers on a channel</li>
<li>Peers validate transactions against endorsement policies and enforce
    the policies</li>
<li>Prior to appending a block, a versioning check is performed to
    ensure that states for assets that were read have not changed since
    chaincode execution time</li>
<li>There is immutability once a transaction is validated and committed</li>
<li>A channel\'s ledger contains a configuration block defining
    policies, access control lists, and other pertinent information</li>
<li>Channel\'s contain [MSP]{role="ref"} instances allowing for crypto
    materials to be derived from different certificate authorities</li>
</ul>
<p>See the [ledger]{role="doc"} topic for a deeper dive on the databases,
storage structure, and \"query-ability.\"</p>
<p>::: {#Privacy-through-Channels}
Privacy through Channels</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>Hyperledger Fabric employs an immutable ledger on a per-channel basis,
as well as chaincodes that can manipulate and modify the current state
of assets (i.e. update key value pairs). A ledger exists in the scope of
a channel - it can be shared across the entire network (assuming every
participant is operating on one common channel) - or it can be
privatized to only include a specific set of participants.</p>
<p>In the latter scenario, these participants would create a separate
channel and thereby isolate/segregate their transactions and ledger. In
order to solve scenarios that want to bridge the gap between total
transparency and privacy, chaincode can be installed only on peers that
need to access the asset states to perform reads and writes (in other
words, if a chaincode is not installed on a peer, it will not be able to
properly interface with the ledger).</p>
<p>To further obfuscate the data, values within chaincode can be encrypted
(in part or in total) using common cryptographic algorithms such as AES
before sending transactions to the ordering service and appending blocks
to the ledger. Once encrypted data has been written to the ledger, it
can only be decrypted by a user in possession of the corresponding key
that was used to generate the cipher text. For further details on
chaincode encryption, see the [chaincode4ade]{role="doc"} topic.</p>
<p>::: {#Security-Membership-Services}
Security &amp; Membership Services</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>Hyperledger Fabric underpins a transactional network where all
participants have known identities. Public Key Infrastructure is used to
generate cryptographic certificates which are tied to organizations,
network components, and end users or client applications. As a result,
data access control can be manipulated and governed on the broader
network and on channel levels. This \"permissioned\" notion of
Hyperledger Fabric, coupled with the existence and capabilities of
channels, helps address scenarios where privacy and confidentiality are
paramount concerns.</p>
<p>See the [msp]{role="doc"} topic to better understand cryptographic
implementations, and the sign, verify, authenticate approach used in
Hyperledger Fabric.</p>
<p>::: {#Consensus}
Consensus</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>In distributed ledger technology, consensus has recently become
synonymous with a specific algorithm, within a single function. However,
consensus encompasses more than simply agreeing upon the order of
transactions, and this differentiation is highlighted in Hyperledger
Fabric through its fundamental role in the entire transaction flow, from
proposal and endorsement, to ordering, validation and commitment. In a
nutshell, consensus is defined as the full-circle verification of the
correctness of a set of transactions comprising a block.</p>
<p>Consensus is ultimately achieved when the order and results of a
block\'s transactions have met the explicit policy criteria checks.
These checks and balances take place during the lifecycle of a
transaction, and include the usage of endorsement policies to dictate
which specific members must endorse a certain transaction class, as well
as system chaincodes to ensure that these policies are enforced and
upheld. Prior to commitment, the peers will employ these system
chaincodes to make sure that enough endorsements are present, and that
they were derived from the appropriate entities. Moreover, a versioning
check will take place during which the current state of the ledger is
agreed or consented upon, before any blocks containing transactions are
appended to the ledger. This final check provides protection against
double spend operations and other threats that might compromise data
integrity, and allows for functions to be executed against non-static
variables.</p>
<p>In addition to the multitude of endorsement, validity and versioning
checks that take place, there are also ongoing identity verifications
happening in all directions of the transaction flow. Access control
lists are implemented on hierarchal layers of the network (ordering
service down to channels), and payloads are repeatedly signed, verified
and authenticated as a transaction proposal passes through the different
architectural components. To conclude, consensus is not merely limited
to the agreed upon order of a batch of transactions, but rather, it is
an overarching characterization that is achieved as a byproduct of the
ongoing verifications that take place during a transaction\'s journey
from proposal to commitment.</p>
<p>Check out the [txflow]{role="doc"} diagram for a visual representation
of consensus.</p>
