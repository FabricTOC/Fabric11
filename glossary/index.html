<h1 id="glossary">Glossary</h1>
<p>Terminology is important, so that all Hyperledger Fabric users and
developers agree on what we mean by each specific term. What is
chaincode, for example. The documentation will reference the glossary as
needed, but feel free to read the entire thing in one sitting if you
like; it\'s pretty enlightening!</p>
<p>::: {#Anchor-Peer}
Anchor Peer</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>A peer node on a channel that all other peers can discover and
communicate with. Each <a href="#member">Member</a> on a channel has an anchor peer
(or multiple anchor peers to prevent single point of failure), allowing
for peers belonging to different Members to discover all existing peers
on a channel.</p>
<p>::: {#Block}
Block</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>An ordered set of transactions that is cryptographically linked to the
preceding block(s) on a channel.</p>
<p>::: {#Chain}
Chain</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>The ledger\'s chain is a transaction log structured as hash-linked
blocks of transactions. Peers receive blocks of transactions from the
ordering service, mark the block\'s transactions as valid or invalid
based on endorsement policies and concurrency violations, and append the
block to the hash chain on the peer\'s file system.</p>
<p>::: {#chaincode}
Chaincode</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>Chaincode is software, running on a ledger, to encode assets and the
transaction instructions (business logic) for modifying the assets.</p>
<p>::: {#Channel}
Channel</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>A channel is a private blockchain overlay which allows for data
isolation and confidentiality. A channel-specific ledger is shared
across the peers in the channel, and transacting parties must be
properly authenticated to a channel in order to interact with it.
Channels are defined by a <a href="#Configuration-Block">Configuration-Block</a>.</p>
<p>::: {#Commitment}
Commitment</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>Each <a href="#peer">Peer</a> on a channel validates ordered blocks of transactions
and then commits (writes/appends) the blocks to its replica of the
channel <a href="#ledger">Ledger</a>. Peers also mark each transaction in each
block as valid or invalid.</p>
<p>::: {#Concurrency-Control-Version-Check}
Concurrency Control Version Check</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>Concurrency Control Version Check is a method of keeping state in sync
across peers on a channel. Peers execute transactions in parallel, and
before commitment to the ledger, peers check that the data read at
execution time has not changed. If the data read for the transaction has
changed between execution time and commitment time, then a Concurrency
Control Version Check violation has occurred, and the transaction is
marked as invalid on the ledger and values are not updated in the state
database.</p>
<p>::: {#Configuration-Block}
Configuration Block</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>Contains the configuration data defining members and policies for a
system chain (ordering service) or channel. Any configuration
modifications to a channel or overall network (e.g. a member leaving or
joining) will result in a new configuration block being appended to the
appropriate chain. This block will contain the contents of the genesis
block, plus the delta.</p>
<h2 id="consensus">Consensus</h2>
<p>A broader term overarching the entire transactional flow, which serves
to generate an agreement on the order and to confirm the correctness of
the set of transactions constituting a block.</p>
<p>::: {#Current-State}
Current State</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>The current state of the ledger represents the latest values for all
keys ever included in its chain transaction log. Peers commit the latest
values to ledger current state for each valid transaction included in a
processed block. Since current state represents all latest key values
known to the channel, it is sometimes referred to as World State.
Chaincode executes transaction proposals against current state data.</p>
<p>::: {#Dynamic-Membership}
Dynamic Membership</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>Hyperledger Fabric supports the addition/removal of members, peers, and
ordering service nodes, without compromising the operationality of the
overall network. Dynamic membership is critical when business
relationships adjust and entities need to be added/removed for various
reasons.</p>
<p>::: {#Endorsement}
Endorsement</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>Refers to the process where specific peer nodes execute a chaincode
transaction and return a proposal response to the client application.
The proposal response includes the chaincode execution response message,
results (read set and write set), and events, as well as a signature to
serve as proof of the peer\'s chaincode execution. Chaincode
applications have corresponding endorsement policies, in which the
endorsing peers are specified.</p>
<p>::: {#Endorsement-policy}
Endorsement policy</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>Defines the peer nodes on a channel that must execute transactions
attached to a specific chaincode application, and the required
combination of responses (endorsements). A policy could require that a
transaction be endorsed by a minimum number of endorsing peers, a
minimum percentage of endorsing peers, or by all endorsing peers that
are assigned to a specific chaincode application. Policies can be
curated based on the application and the desired level of resilience
against misbehavior (deliberate or not) by the endorsing peers. A
transaction that is submitted must satisfy the endorsement policy before
being marked as valid by committing peers. A distinct endorsement policy
for install and instantiate transactions is also required.</p>
<p>::: {#Fabric-ca}
Hyperledger Fabric CA</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>Hyperledger Fabric CA is the default Certificate Authority component,
which issues PKI-based certificates to network member organizations and
their users. The CA issues one root certificate (rootCert) to each
member and one enrollment certificate (ECert) to each authorized user.</p>
<p>::: {#Genesis-Block}
Genesis Block</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>The configuration block that initializes a blockchain network or
channel, and also serves as the first block on a chain.</p>
<p>::: {#Gossip-Protocol}
Gossip Protocol</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>The gossip data dissemination protocol performs three functions: 1)
manages peer discovery and channel membership; 2) disseminates ledger
data across all peers on the channel; 3) syncs ledger state across all
peers on the channel. Refer to the [Gossip \&lt;gossip>]{role="doc"} topic
for more details.</p>
<p>::: {#Initialize}
Initialize</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>A method to initialize a chaincode application.</p>
<h2 id="install">Install</h2>
<p>The process of placing a chaincode on a peer\'s file system.</p>
<h2 id="instantiate">Instantiate</h2>
<p>The process of starting and initializing a chaincode application on a
specific channel. After instantiation, peers that have the chaincode
installed can accept chaincode invocations.</p>
<p>::: {#Invoke}
Invoke</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>Used to call chaincode functions. A client application invokes chaincode
by sending a transaction proposal to a peer. The peer will execute the
chaincode and return an endorsed proposal response to the client
application. The client application will gather enough proposal
responses to satisfy an endorsement policy, and will then submit the
transaction results for ordering, validation, and commit. The client
application may choose not to submit the transaction results. For
example if the invoke only queried the ledger, the client application
typically would not submit the read-only transaction, unless there is
desire to log the read on the ledger for audit purpose. The invoke
includes a channel identifier, the chaincode function to invoke, and an
array of arguments.</p>
<p>::: {#Leading-Peer}
Leading Peer</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>Each <a href="#member">Member</a> can own multiple peers on each channel that it
subscribes to. One of these peers is serves as the leading peer for the
channel, in order to communicate with the network ordering service on
behalf of the member. The ordering service \"delivers\" blocks to the
leading peer(s) on a channel, who then distribute them to other peers
within the same member cluster.</p>
<p>::: {#Ledger}
Ledger</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>A ledger is a channel\'s chain and current state data which is
maintained by each peer on the channel.</p>
<p>::: {#Member}
Member</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>A legally separate entity that owns a unique root certificate for the
network. Network components such as peer nodes and application clients
will be linked to a member.</p>
<p>::: {#MSP}
Membership Service Provider</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>The Membership Service Provider (MSP) refers to an abstract component of
the system that provides credentials to clients, and peers for them to
participate in a Hyperledger Fabric network. Clients use these
credentials to authenticate their transactions, and peers use these
credentials to authenticate transaction processing results
(endorsements). While strongly connected to the transaction processing
components of the systems, this interface aims to have membership
services components defined, in such a way that alternate
implementations of this can be smoothly plugged in without modifying the
core of transaction processing components of the system.</p>
<p>::: {#Membership-Services}
Membership Services</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>Membership Services authenticates, authorizes, and manages identities on
a permissioned blockchain network. The membership services code that
runs in peers and orderers both authenticates and authorizes blockchain
operations. It is a PKI-based implementation of the Membership Services
Provider (MSP) abstraction.</p>
<p>::: {#Ordering-Service}
Ordering Service</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>A defined collective of nodes that orders transactions into a block. The
ordering service exists independent of the peer processes and orders
transactions on a first-come-first-serve basis for all channel\'s on the
network. The ordering service is designed to support pluggable
implementations beyond the out-of-the-box SOLO and Kafka varieties. The
ordering service is a common binding for the overall network; it
contains the cryptographic identity material tied to each
<a href="#member">Member</a>.</p>
<p>::: {#Peer}
Peer</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>A network entity that maintains a ledger and runs chaincode containers
in order to perform read/write operations to the ledger. Peers are owned
and maintained by members.</p>
<p>::: {#Policy}
Policy</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>There are policies for endorsement, validation, chaincode management and
network/channel management.</p>
<p>::: {#Proposal}
Proposal</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>A request for endorsement that is aimed at specific peers on a channel.
Each proposal is either an instantiate or an invoke (read/write)
request.</p>
<p>::: {#Query}
Query</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>A query is a chaincode invocation which reads the ledger current state
but does not write to the ledger. The chaincode function may query
certain keys on the ledger, or may query for a set of keys on the
ledger. Since queries do not change ledger state, the client application
will typically not submit these read-only transactions for ordering,
validation, and commit. Although not typical, the client application can
choose to submit the read-only transaction for ordering, validation, and
commit, for example if the client wants auditable proof on the ledger
chain that it had knowledge of specific ledger state at a certain point
in time.</p>
<p>::: {#SDK}
Software Development Kit (SDK)</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>The Hyperledger Fabric client SDK provides a structured environment of
libraries for developers to write and test chaincode applications. The
SDK is fully configurable and extensible through a standard interface.
Components, including cryptographic algorithms for signatures, logging
frameworks and state stores, are easily swapped in and out of the SDK.
The SDK provides APIs for transaction processing, membership services,
node traversal and event handling. The SDK comes in multiple flavors:
Node.js, Java. and Python.</p>
<p>::: {#State-DB}
State Database</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>Current state data is stored in a state database for efficient reads and
queries from chaincode. Supported databases include levelDB and couchDB.</p>
<p>::: {#System-Chain}
System Chain</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>Contains a configuration block defining the network at a system level.
The system chain lives within the ordering service, and similar to a
channel, has an initial configuration containing information such as:
MSP information, policies, and configuration details. Any change to the
overall network (e.g. a new org joining or a new ordering node being
added) will result in a new configuration block being added to the
system chain.</p>
<p>The system chain can be thought of as the common binding for a channel
or group of channels. For instance, a collection of financial
institutions may form a consortium (represented through the system
chain), and then proceed to create channels relative to their aligned
and varying business agendas.</p>
<p>::: {#Transaction}
Transaction</p>
<hr />
<p>:::</p>
<p>Invoke or instantiate results that are submitted for ordering,
validation, and commit. Invokes are requests to read/write data from the
ledger. Instantiate is a request to start and initialize a chaincode on
a channel. Application clients gather invoke or instantiate responses
from endorsing peers and package the results and endorsements into a
transaction that is submitted for ordering, validation, and commit.</p>
