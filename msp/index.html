                <h1 id="membership-service-providers-msp">Membership Service Providers (MSP)</h1>
<p>The document serves to provide details on the setup and best practices
for MSPs.</p>
<p>Membership Service Provider (MSP) is a component that aims to offer an
abstraction of a membership operation architecture.</p>
<p>In particular, MSP abstracts away all cryptographic mechanisms and
protocols behind issuing and validating certificates, and user
authentication. An MSP may define their own notion of identity, and the
rules by which those identities are governed (identity validation) and
authenticated (signature generation and verification).</p>
<p>A Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network can be governed by one or more
MSPs. This provides modularity of membership operations, and
interoperability across different membership standards and
architectures.</p>
<p>In the rest of this document we elaborate on the setup of the MSP
implementation supported by Hyperledger Fabric, and discuss best
practices concerning its use.</p>
<h2 id="msp-configuration">MSP Configuration</h2>
<p>To setup an instance of the MSP, its configuration needs to be specified
locally at each peer and orderer (to enable peer, and orderer signing),
and on the channels to enable peer, orderer, client identity validation,
and respective signature verification (authentication) by and for all
channel members.</p>
<p>Firstly, for each MSP a name needs to be specified in order to reference
that MSP in the network (e.g. <code>msp1</code>, <code>org2</code>, and <code>org3.divA</code>). This is
the name under which membership rules of an MSP representing a
consortium, organization or organization division is to be referenced in
a channel. This is also referred to as the <em>MSP Identifier</em> or <em>MSP ID</em>.
MSP Identifiers are required to be unique per MSP instance. For example,
shall two MSP instances with the same identifier be detected at the
system channel genesis, orderer setup will fail.</p>
<p>In the case of default implementation of MSP, a set of parameters need
to be specified to allow for identity (certificate) validation and
signature verification. These parameters are deduced by
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5280.txt">RFC5280</a>, and include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A list of self-signed (X.509) certificates to constitute the <em>root
    of trust</em></li>
<li>A list of X.509 certificates to represent intermediate CAs this
    provider considers for certificate validation; these certificates
    ought to be certified by exactly one of the certificates in the root
    of trust; intermediate CAs are optional parameters</li>
<li>A list of X.509 certificates with a verifiable certificate path to
    exactly one of the certificates of the root of trust to represent
    the administrators of this MSP; owners of these certificates are
    authorized to request changes to this MSP configuration (e.g. root
    CAs, intermediate CAs)</li>
<li>A list of Organizational Units that valid members of this MSP should
    include in their X.509 certificate; this is an optional
    configuration parameter, used when, e.g., multiple organisations
    leverage the same root of trust, and intermediate CAs, and have
    reserved an OU field for their members</li>
<li>A list of certificate revocation lists (CRLs) each corresponding to
    exactly one of the listed (intermediate or root) MSP Certificate
    Authorities; this is an optional parameter</li>
<li>A list of self-signed (X.509) certificates to constitute the <em>TLS
    root of trust</em> for TLS certificate.</li>
<li>A list of X.509 certificates to represent intermediate TLS CAs this
    provider considers; these certificates ought to be certified by
    exactly one of the certificates in the TLS root of trust;
    intermediate CAs are optional parameters.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Valid</em> identities for this MSP instance are required to satisfy the
following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are in the form of X.509 certificates with a verifiable
    certificate path to exactly one of the root of trust certificates;</li>
<li>They are not included in any CRL;</li>
<li>And they <em>list</em> one or more of the Organizational Units of the MSP
    configuration in the <code>OU</code> field of their X.509 certificate
    structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on the validity of identities in the current MSP
implementation, we refer the reader to
[msp-identity-validity-rules]{role="doc"}.</p>
<p>In addition to verification related parameters, for the MSP to enable
the node on which it is instantiated to sign or authenticate, one needs
to specify:</p>
<ul>
<li>The signing key used for signing by the node (currently only ECDSA
    keys are supported), and</li>
<li>The node\'s X.509 certificate, that is a valid identity under the
    verification parameters of this MSP.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that MSP identities never expire; they can only
be revoked by adding them to the appropriate CRLs. Additionally, there
is currently no support for enforcing revocation of TLS certificates.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-generate-msp-certificates-and-their-signing-keys">How to generate MSP certificates and their signing keys?</h2>
<p>To generate X.509 certificates to feed its MSP configuration, the
application can use <a href="https://www.openssl.org/">Openssl</a>. We emphasise
that in Hyperledger Fabric there is no support for certificates
including RSA keys.</p>
<p>Alternatively one can use <code>cryptogen</code> tool, whose operation is explained
in [getting_started]{role="doc"}.</p>
<p><a href="http://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Hyperledger Fabric
CA</a> can also be
used to generate the keys and certificates needed to configure an MSP.</p>
<h2 id="msp-setup-on-the-peer-orderer-side">MSP setup on the peer &amp; orderer side</h2>
<p>To set up a local MSP (for either a peer or an orderer), the
administrator should create a folder (e.g. <code>$MY_PATH/mspconfig</code>) that
contains six subfolders and a file:</p>
<ol>
<li>a folder <code>admincerts</code> to include PEM files each corresponding to an
    administrator certificate</li>
<li>a folder <code>cacerts</code> to include PEM files each corresponding to a root
    CA\'s certificate</li>
<li>(optional) a folder <code>intermediatecerts</code> to include PEM files each
    corresponding to an intermediate CA\'s certificate</li>
<li>(optional) a file <code>config.yaml</code> to include information on the
    considered OUs; the latter are defined as pairs of
    <code>&lt;Certificate, OrganizationalUnitIdentifier&gt;</code> entries of a yaml
    array called <code>OrganizationalUnitIdentifiers</code>, where <code>Certificate</code>
    represents the relative path to the certificate of the certificate
    authority (root or intermediate) that should be considered for
    certifying members of this organizational unit (e.g.
    ./cacerts/cacert.pem), and <code>OrganizationalUnitIdentifier</code> represents
    the actual string as expected to appear in X.509 certificate
    OU-field (e.g. \"COP\")</li>
<li>(optional) a folder <code>crls</code> to include the considered CRLs</li>
<li>a folder <code>keystore</code> to include a PEM file with the node\'s signing
    key; we emphasise that currently RSA keys are not supported</li>
<li>a folder <code>signcerts</code> to include a PEM file with the node\'s X.509
    certificate</li>
<li>(optional) a folder <code>tlscacerts</code> to include PEM files each
    corresponding to a TLS root CA\'s certificate</li>
<li>(optional) a folder <code>tlsintermediatecerts</code> to include PEM files each
    corresponding to an intermediate TLS CA\'s certificate</li>
</ol>
<p>In the configuration file of the node (core.yaml file for the peer, and
orderer.yaml for the orderer), one needs to specify the path to the
mspconfig folder, and the MSP Identifier of the node\'s MSP. The path to
the mspconfig folder is expected to be relative to FABRIC_CFG_PATH and
is provided as the value of parameter <code>mspConfigPath</code> for the peer, and
<code>LocalMSPDir</code> for the orderer. The identifier of the node\'s MSP is
provided as a value of parameter <code>localMspId</code> for the peer and
<code>LocalMSPID</code> for the orderer. These variables can be overridden via the
environment using the CORE prefix for peer (e.g. CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID)
and the ORDERER prefix for the orderer (e.g.
ORDERER_GENERAL_LOCALMSPID). Notice that for the orderer setup, one
needs to generate, and provide to the orderer the genesis block of the
system channel. The MSP configuration needs of this block are detailed
in the next section.</p>
<p><em>Reconfiguration</em> of a \"local\" MSP is only possible manually, and
requires that the peer or orderer process is restarted. In subsequent
releases we aim to offer online/dynamic reconfiguration (i.e. without
requiring to stop the node by using a node managed system chaincode).</p>
<h2 id="channel-msp-setup">Channel MSP setup</h2>
<p>At the genesis of the system, verification parameters of all the MSPs
that appear in the network need to be specified, and included in the
system channel\'s genesis block. Recall that MSP verification parameters
consist of the MSP identifier, the root of trust certificates,
intermediate CA and admin certificates, as well as OU specifications and
CRLs. The system genesis block is provided to the orderers at their
setup phase, and allows them to authenticate channel creation requests.
Orderers would reject the system genesis block, if the latter includes
two MSPs with the same identifier, and consequently the bootstrapping of
the network would fail.</p>
<p>For application channels, the verification components of only the MSPs
that govern a channel need to reside in the channel\'s genesis block. We
emphasise that it is <strong>the responsibility of the application</strong> to ensure
that correct MSP configuration information is included in the genesis
blocks (or the most recent configuration block) of a channel prior to
instructing one or more of their peers to join the channel.</p>
<p>When bootstrapping a channel with the help of the configtxgen tool, one
can configure the channel MSPs by including the verification parameters
of MSP in the mspconfig folder, and setting that path in the relevant
section in <code>configtx.yaml</code>.</p>
<p><em>Reconfiguration</em> of an MSP on the channel, including announcements of
the certificate revocation lists associated to the CAs of that MSP is
achieved through the creation of a <code>config_update</code> object by the owner
of one of the administrator certificates of the MSP. The client
application managed by the admin would then announce this update to the
channels in which this MSP appears.</p>
<h2 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h2>
<p>In this section we elaborate on best practices for MSP configuration in
commonly met scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>1) Mapping between organizations/corporations and MSPs</strong></p>
<p>We recommend that there is a one-to-one mapping between organizations
and MSPs. If a different mapping type of mapping is chosen, the
following needs to be to considered:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>One organization employing various MSPs.</strong> This corresponds to the
    case of an organization including a variety of divisions each
    represented by its MSP, either for management independence reasons,
    or for privacy reasons. In this case a peer can only be owned by a
    single MSP, and will not recognize peers with identities from other
    MSPs as peers of the same organization. The implication of this is
    that peers may share through gossip organization-scoped data with a
    set of peers that are members of the same subdivision, and NOT with
    the full set of providers constituting the actual organization.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple organizations using a single MSP.</strong> This corresponds to a
    case of a consortium of organisations that are governed by similar
    membership architecture. One needs to know here that peers would
    propagate organization-scoped messages to the peers that have an
    identity under the same MSP regardless of whether they belong to the
    same actual organization. This is a limitation of the granularity of
    MSP definition, and/or of the peer's configuration.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2) One organization has different divisions (say organizational
units), to</strong> <strong>which it wants to grant access to different channels.</strong></p>
<p>Two ways to handle this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Define one MSP to accommodate membership for all organization's
    members</strong>. Configuration of that MSP would consist of a list of root
    CAs, intermediate CAs and admin certificates; and membership
    identities would include the organizational unit (<code>OU</code>) a member
    belongs to. Policies can then be defined to capture members of a
    specific <code>OU</code>, and these policies may constitute the read/write
    policies of a channel or endorsement policies of a chaincode. A
    limitation of this approach is that gossip peers would consider
    peers with membership identities under their local MSP as members of
    the same organization, and would consequently gossip with them
    organisation-scoped data (e.g. their status).</li>
<li><strong>Defining one MSP to represent each division</strong>. This would involve
    specifying for each division, a set of certificates for root CAs,
    intermediate CAs, and admin Certs, such that there is no overlapping
    certification path across MSPs. This would mean that, for example, a
    different intermediate CA per subdivision is employed. Here the
    disadvantage is the management of more than one MSPs instead of one,
    but this circumvents the issue present in the previous approach. One
    could also define one MSP for each division by leveraging an OU
    extension of the MSP configuration.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3) Separating clients from peers of the same organization.</strong></p>
<p>In many cases it is required that the "type" of an identity is
retrievable from the identity itself (e.g. it may be needed that
endorsements are guaranteed to have derived by peers, and not clients or
nodes acting solely as orderers).</p>
<p>There is limited support for such requirements.</p>
<p>One way to allow for this separation is to to create a separate
intermediate CA for each node type - one for clients and one for
peers/orderers; and configure two different MSPs - one for clients and
one for peers/orderers. Channels this organization should be accessing
would need to include both MSPs, while endorsement policies will
leverage only the MSP that refers to the peers. This would ultimately
result in the organization being mapped to two MSP instances, and would
have certain consequences on the way peers and clients interact.</p>
<p>Gossip would not be drastically impacted as all peers of the same
organization would still belong to one MSP. Peers can restrict the
execution of certain system chaincodes to local MSP based policies. For
example, peers would only execute "joinChannel" request if the request
is signed by the admin of their local MSP who can only be a client
(end-user should be sitting at the origin of that request). We can go
around this inconsistency if we accept that the only clients to be
members of a peer/orderer MSP would be the administrators of that MSP.</p>
<p>Another point to be considered with this approach is that peers
authorize event registration requests based on membership of request
originator within their local MSP. Clearly, since the originator of the
request is a client, the request originator is always doomed to belong
to a different MSP than the requested peer and the peer would reject the
request.</p>
<p><strong>4) Admin and CA certificates.</strong></p>
<p>It is important to set MSP admin certificates to be different than any
of the certificates considered by the MSP for <code>root of trust</code>, or
intermediate CAs. This is a common (security) practice to separate the
duties of management of membership components from the issuing of new
certificates, and/or validation of existing ones.</p>
<p><strong>5) Blacklisting an intermediate CA.</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned in previous sections, reconfiguration of an MSP is achieved
by reconfiguration mechanisms (manual reconfiguration for the local MSP
instances, and via properly constructed <code>config_update</code> messages for MSP
instances of a channel). Clearly, there are two ways to ensure an
intermediate CA considered in an MSP is no longer considered for that
MSP\'s identity validation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reconfigure the MSP to no longer include the certificate of that
    intermediate CA in the list of trusted intermediate CA certs. For
    the locally configured MSP, this would mean that the certificate of
    this CA is removed from the <code>intermediatecerts</code> folder.</li>
<li>Reconfigure the MSP to include a CRL produced by the root of trust
    which denounces the mentioned intermediate CA\'s certificate.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the current MSP implementation we only support method (1) as it is
simpler and does not require blacklisting the no longer considered
intermediate CA.</p>
<p><strong>6) CAs and TLS CAs</strong></p>
<p>MSP identities\' root CAs and MSP TLS certificates\' root CAs (and
relative intermediate CAs) need to be declared in different folders.
This is to avoid confusion between different classes of certificates. It
is not forbidden to reuse the same CAs for both MSP identities and TLS
certificates but best practices suggest to avoid this in production.</p>
